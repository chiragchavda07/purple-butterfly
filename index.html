  <p>Hello Doctor ji, "doctor ji" thoda odd lag rha hai, "ma'am" thik rahega 😅… 
    Heyy.. Ma'am, I don’t have anything fancy to say. Just something real.</p>

  <p>Aur haan upar se aapka fav song bhi baja sakte ho, mast gaana sunte sunte padhna</p>
  <p> The reason I’ve been trying to keep this bond alive isn't because I want anything from you.
  It’s just that I like you as a person, ma’am.👩🏻‍⚕️
  And I didn’t want to lose the understanding we had — something so rare and genuine.</p>

  <p>I’ve never seen this connection through any label — not as a “relationship” or “just friends.”
  I always thought of it as something real — where we could be completely ourselves.
  A space like a diary — honest, unfiltered, safe.</p>

  <p>You know, I’m not like your other friends.
  I don’t try to act like someone else.
  I’m just me.
  Maybe different.
  Maybe a bit weird, even like an alien sometimes.👽😄
  But whatever I am, I’ve always been genuine with you.</p>

  <p>A lot of times I think, "Kaash woh pehle wali vibe wapas aa jaye... kaash hum partner ban jayein."
  But I know, not everything is in our hands — a lot depends on what God has written for us.</p>

  <p>I know you’ve said we’ll always be friends — and I truly value that, ma’am.👩🏻‍⚕️
  But sometimes, I overthink.🙃</p>

  <p>I start feeling like maybe I did something wrong…
  Something unintentional, something neither of us had control over.
  And because of that, kai kabaar to esa darr bhi rehta hai ki kahin esi incredible person ko kho na du!!</p>

  <p>On some days, that feeling becomes heavy —
  I feel low, sometimes angry, when there’s complete silence between us and sometime I feel jealous too.🥲</p>

  <p>I know from your perspective, it could all look totally different.
  And I respect that.🙃</p>

  <p>But this is how I feel.
  And it's just in my nature to share, not to hide or pretend.
  That’s all.
  Nothing more, nothing less.
  Just me, being real — like I’ve always tried to be.</p>

  <p>I’m not saying this to get a certain reply…<br>
  Even silence is okay.<br>
  I just didn’t want to keep it inside.<br>
  I always wanted to be honest with you, like I’ve tried to be from the start.</p>

  <p>So, if you ever feel like sharing your side, I’m here to listen.<br>
  Baaki to mane khbr j chhe, k mane koi bhi vaat nhi game to bhi tu e vat karine mane angry karis🤭, kyuki tu hai hi eshi nakhrebaaz naughty cat 😾<br>
  Haan thoda dhyan rakho ki me jyada angry na ho jau 😅<br>
  And sorry aatlu laambu vachva mate ane upar ni or past ni koi bhi vaat or action thi khotu lagyu hoy to, sorry kevathi mari koi value to ghati nai javaani🤭<br>
  
  Aur haan ab ye mat samjna ki me impress karne ki try kar rha hoon, naa!! illeee...😂😂😂
  That’s all. ❤️</p>

  <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">— From someone who genuinely cares 🌻</p>
