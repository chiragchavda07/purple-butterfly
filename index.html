    <p>Hey… I don’t have anything fancy to say. Just something real.</p>

    <p>If there’s ever anything stuck in your heart or mind — something you wanted to say but didn’t — I hope you always feel free to share it with me.<br>
    No pressure, no expectations.</p>

    <p>The reason I’ve been trying to keep this bond alive isn't because I want anything from you.<br>
    It’s just that I like you as a person.<br>
    And I didn’t want to lose the understanding we had.</p>

    <p>I’ve never seen this connection through any label — not as a “relationship” or “just friends.”<br>
    I always thought of it as something real — where we could be completely ourselves.<br>
    A space like a diary — honest, unfiltered, safe.</p>

    <p>You know, I’m not like your other friends.<br>
    I don’t try to act like someone else.<br>
    I’m just me.<br>
    Maybe different.<br>
    Maybe a bit weird, even like an alien sometimes.<br>
    But whatever I am, I’m always genuine.</p>

    <p>I know you’ve said we’ll always be friends — and I truly value that.<br>
    But sometimes I overthink.</p>

    <p>I start feeling like maybe I did something wrong…<br>
    Something unintentional, something neither of us had control over.<br>
    And because of that, I sometimes feel a quiet fear of losing what we had.</p>

    <p>On some days, that feeling becomes heavy —<br>
    I feel low, sometimes angry, even jealous when there’s complete silence between us.</p>

    <p>I know from your perspective, it could all look totally different.<br>
    And I respect that.</p>

    <p>But this is how I feel.<br>
    And it's just in my nature to share, not to hide or pretend.<br>
    That’s all.<br>
    Nothing more, nothing less.<br>
    Just me, being real — like I’ve always tried to be.</p>

    <p>I’m not saying this to get a certain reply…<br>
    Even silence is okay.<br>
    I just didn’t want to keep it inside.<br>
    That’s all. ❤️ </p>
